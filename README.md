# ERC20 and Vault Contracts

This repository contains two smart contracts: ERC20 and Vault.

## ERC20 Contract

The ERC20 contract implements the standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic functionalities such as transferring tokens, approving transfers, and checking balances. 

## Vault Contract

The Vault contract is a secure storage solution for ERC20 tokens. It allows users to deposit tokens into the vault and withdraw them as needed. The vault ensures the safety of the deposited tokens through robust security measures.

## Usage

1. Deploy the ERC20 contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Deploy the Vault contract, passing the address of the ERC20 contract as a parameter.
3. Interact with the ERC20 contract to mint tokens and transfer them.
4. Use the Vault contract to deposit tokens securely and withdraw them when required.
